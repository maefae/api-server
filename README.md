## Project: REST API Server, Data Modeling, with TDD

### Author: Megan Seibert-Hughes

### Problem Domain

- Build a REST API using Express, by creating a proper series of endpoints that perform CRUD operations on a database, including server modularization, use of middleware, a model interface, and tests using the standard.

### Links and Resources

- deployment

### Setup

`.env` requirements (where applicable)
see `.env.sample`

- `PORT` - 3002

PUT : /food - UPDATE one record
PUT : /clothes - UPDATE one record
DELETE : /food - DESTROY one record
DELETE : /clothes - DESTROY one record
Feature Two: PostgresSQL, sqlite
Feature Three: SQL Data Models
Feature Four: REST Route Handlers
Feature Five: Collection Interface for CRUD operations

Tests

- How do you run tests?
  - npm test
- Any tests of note?
  - 404 on a bad route
  - 404 on a bad method
  - The correct status codes and returned data for each REST route:
    - Create a record using POST
    - Read a list of records using GET
    - Read a record using GET
    - Update a record using PUT
    - Destroy a record using DELETE
